The program does not require a makefile since I am using python.

The initial port server port for the server to work is and the client is 20238, to initially connect to the server

To compile and run the program run "chmod +x ./server.sh" and "chmod +x ./client.sh", aside from that you should also make
both the python files executable with "chmod +x ./server.py" and "chmod +x ./client.py"

Problem shooting: 
If by any chance there is the error that it couldn't connect, just run the ./clien/sh again.
